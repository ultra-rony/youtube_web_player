## 0.0.1

## Initial Release

This is the initial release of the `youtube_web_player` package, which allows you to seamlessly integrate a native WebView to play YouTube videos within your Flutter application.

### Features
- **WebView Integration**: Easily embed YouTube videos using the YouTube embed URL.
- **Responsive Design**: The player adjusts to the size of its parent widget, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.
- **Lightweight**: Minimalistic approach with no additional dependencies other than the `flutter_inappwebview` package.

### Current Status
- **Beta Version**: This package is currently in beta. While we have implemented the core functionality, we expect further enhancements and optimizations in future releases. Your feedback is welcome to help improve the package.

### Usage
To use the `youtube_web_player` library, please refer to the documentation for setup instructions and examples.

We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to refine and improve this library for the Flutter community.
